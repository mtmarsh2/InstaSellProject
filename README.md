InstaSellProject
================

An online selling web application using Instagram to find and market to local buyers and sellers of any item. 
Sellers can tag pictures on Instagram with "#InstaSell", and the web app will find all posts with the tag and display them on the site. Buyers can search by item and by seller proximity. Buyers and sellers communicate through texting through a proxy number, so neither person knows the other's actual phone number, increasing safety for both.
